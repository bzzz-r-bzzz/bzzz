## Rationale

This tool was created as a replacement in a project where multiple methodologies were being used to persist data.

Based on the combined requirements the tool provides the following:

- [x] automatically stringify / parse data
- [x] optionally auto prefix and or suffix keys
- [x] optionally provide mechanism to sync data changed between tabs
- [x] optionally use obfuscation for the store values
- [ ] (undecided) provide ability to define the storage
      technically this already possible, however many alternates use
      promises, so to fully support we will have to use async / await
      no bit deal just not sure we need it at the mo.
- [x] bactch calls
      the existing project has a Persist utility that batched calls
      with a debounce, this is due to calls being made frequently
      in short timeframes.
      ~~this would add more complexity to the code and I'm undecided
      about it, and perhaps it should be the responsibility of the consumer.~~
      extension class `PersistToolBatch`
      ** Not sure if I'll keep batch version in future, it prod I didnt see any time non batch fail **
- [x] provide a "no opperation" instance (more on that later)
- [x] a way to `clear` that doesnt clear other persists

## Example

`import { PersistTool } from '@bzzz/persist'`

Create an instance:

`const persist = new PersistTool()`

This would give you an api that writes to `localStorage` with keys that match exactly what you provide.
In other words, if you were to create multiple instances of `new PersistTool()` they would all read/write the same key in storage.

Use for global generic items.

**Batch version**

Same as normal except it has a `delay` option (default: 500ms)

`const persist = new PersistToolBatch();` / `const persist = new PersistToolBatch({delay: 1000});`

setItem, getItem, removeItem work instantly writing to a store and the actual (setItem) persist to Storage is delayed on each call.
Thus after `delay` of the last setItem call all pendizng writes will be added to the Storage.

### Prefix / Suffix

**prefix**

`const persist = new PersistTool({prefix: 'myPrefix'})`

This would give you an api that writes to `localStorage` and prefix the keys.

`const fullKey = persist.setItem('test', 1) === 'myPrefixtest'`

Provide a seperator:

`const persist = new PersistTool({prefix: 'myPrefix', seperator: '_})`

`const fullKey = persist.setItem('test', 1) === 'myPrefix_test'`

**suffix**

`const persist = new PersistTool({suffix: 'mySuffix', seperator: '_})`

`const fullKey = persist.setItem('test', 1) === 'test_mySuffix'`

**both**

`const persist = new PersistTool({prefix: 'myPrefix', suffix: 'mySuffix', seperator: '_})`

`const fullKey = persist.setItem('test', 1) === 'myPrefix_test_mySuffix'`

Typically suffix is useful for cases where you may want to store items agains something like a unique user uid, but want the keys to be easy to read in the localStorage inspector.
